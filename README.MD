# Project Description:

This project explores and applies the Atomic Design Methodology to UI/UX design by analyzing and creating structured design systems. Atomic Design breaks down interfaces into smaller components to ensure modularity, reusability, and scalability in UI libraries.

The project consists of several tasks designed to understand how design elements (atoms, molecules, organisms, templates) are identified, organized, and applied across different platforms and use cases.

## Goals:

   - Analyze and Capture: Identify and categorize design components (atoms, molecules, organisms, templates) from real-world websites and applications.
   - Layer Analysis: Understand the composition and layering of UI elements.
   - Design System Creation: Build design systems for different themes, such as a climbing group and a dating app, with emphasis on clarity, consistency, and usability.
